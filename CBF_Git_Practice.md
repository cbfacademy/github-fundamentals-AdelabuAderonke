#NOTES ON WHAT I LEARNT ON GIT
Git is a version control system. It is used mainly for collaboration and keeping track of code changes.
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere
Repository: a place where we store our files. 
Remote:It can be a folder on cloud or on some websites like GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket or anywhere. It serve as a backup if your machine was crashed by power fluctuations or any other problems. 

###Commands in git
- Git ‚Äìversion: This is used to check the version of git
	$ git ‚Äìversion

$ git clone repo url
- Git add:Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area 
- Git status: It displays information about a current repository that is the state of the repository by listing out all the files in the repository
	$ git status
- Git pull: It is used to fetch and update content on the local repository from the remote repository

- Git init:Initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place a project under revision control, this is the first command you need to learn.
          $  git init

  ###Confused? üòï
  Yes, I am still confused if I can create  a repository locally without having to create a repository on Github. Once I push from the terminal it will appear automatically.
  I have always dreaded Git, CBF is making it interesting üòé
